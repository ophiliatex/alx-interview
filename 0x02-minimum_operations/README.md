# Minimum Operations Project

## Description

This project involves calculating the minimum number of operations needed to achieve a given number of characters `n` using only two operations: "Copy All" and "Paste". 

Given a number `n`, the goal is to determine the fewest number of operations required to result in exactly `n` characters in a text file that initially contains only one character "H".

## Concepts and Resources

To solve this problem, the following concepts are crucial:

1. **Dynamic Programming**:
    - Breaking down the problem into simpler subproblems.
    - Building up the solution incrementally.

2. **Prime Factorization**:
    - Reducing the problem to finding the sum of the prime factors of the target number `n`.

3. **Code Optimization**:
    - Approaching problems from an optimization perspective to find the most efficient solution.

4. **Greedy Algorithms**:
    - Choosing the best option at each step to find the overall optimum solution.

5. **Basic Python Programming**:
    - Proficiency in loops, conditionals, and functions to implement the solution.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.4.3)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
- Code should be documented
- Code should follow the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- All files must be executable

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/johnamet/alx-interview.git
    ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd alx-interview/0x02-minimum_operations
    ```

## Usage

To use the `minOperations` function, you can run the `0-main.py` script. For example:

```bash
$ ./0-main.py
Min # of operations to reach 4 char: 4
Min # of operations to reach 12 char: 7
Min # of operations to reach 24 char: 9
Min # of operations to reach 1 char: 0
Min # of operations to reach 13 char: 13
